# MCSB 2021: Let's edit a poem

A group activity where we each edit a line of the poem by singer/songwriter Will Smith, __The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air__.

The plan:

1. In groups of 3-4, pick one "primary".

2. If you are primary, fork this repo from allardjun. The "Fork" button is at top-right

3. If you are not the primary, click the number to the right of the "Fork" button. You will see a list of primaries who have forked it from allardjun. Fork the repo from the primary in your group. Note it might take a minute for the lucky users from Step 2 to fork first.

4. Everyone: In *your* repo, click the file `main.tex`. Click the edit button, which is a pencil icon at the right of the screen, between a monitor icon and a trash icon.

5. Edit a line in the poem to say whatever you want (this will be public).

6. Commit! The button is at the bottom of screen

7. Make a Pull Request. Use the "Pull Request" tab in the horizontal tab list, and then "New Pull Request" button on right of the screen.
